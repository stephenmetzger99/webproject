        <h1>Design. Build. Compete.</h1>
        <p>
            The team consists of engineering students of various disciplines with the goal of building a formula style race car for the annual <a href="https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events">FSAE</a> competion in Lincoln, Nebraska. I became a member of Louisville's FSAE team at the start of the spring semester in 2018. Almost every part of the car was designed and fabricated by students. We do all of our work at the J.B. Speed Engineering Innovation Center and GE's FirstBuild. Our team consists of smaller subteams for chassis, powertrain, aero, and electronics. I became captain of the electronics subteam after one semester as a freshman. Much of my time has been spent working on the electronics of the vehicle and computer programming. I am responsible for building the dashboard, steering wheel, paddle shifting, and programming the onboard computers. Nowadays I also help with recruitment for the team and have begun presenting to groups of prospective freshman. Building the car is a formative learning experience that has given me valuable experience about how to work in a sophisticated engineering team. Not only this, but it has given me the technical abilities to take an idea from concept to design using advanced machinery such as CNC mills, laser cutters, 3D printers, and water jets. I’ve even met some of my best friends on the team. Having an impact on the team and the knowledge I’ve gained has solidified my love for engineering.

            The steering wheel and paddle shifters were designed in solidworks and fabricated from steel and carbon fiber.

            The steering wheel was brought to life with an <i>Arduino Uno R3</i>. The steering wheel features an LCD display with outputs, LED rpm lights, and magnetic paddle shifters. All of the work on it can be found on my
