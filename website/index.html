            <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>My name is Stephen Metzger. I am a sophomore at the Univeristy of Louisville's J.B. Speed School of Engineering. Engineering is something that comes very naturally to me, whether it's creating something physical or writing code. I have a love for technology, which has driven me to choose a computer engineering/computer science career. If you're interested in seeing what I've done so far, check out my resume.  </p>

            <h2>Projects I'm Working On</h2>
             <p>I'd like this site to be a nice place to see the things I'm working on that relate to my major. In this section I'll discuss my work in a fashion similar to a blog (hopefully in a non-pretentious way). Come and see what I'm working on from class projects, to my involvement with the Louisville Formula Racing Team, to personal projects.</p>

             <p>Photos of stuff I'm working on, especially from the UofL formula team. Other than that It might just be photos I take while outdoors, etc.</p>
